If you want to get in contact with me for any reason the best method is email (I make reasonable efforts to reply to [email](mailto:contact@bensouchet.dev?body=Hi%20Ben,%0D%0A%0D%0A){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} I receive, however I cannot guarantee you’ll receive a response).


You can also message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/BenSouchet/) (I don’t post often but I watch regularly).
